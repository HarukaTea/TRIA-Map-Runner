## TRIA MAP STUDIO TESTER

> A project that allows you to run TRIA maps in Roblox Studio.

Making maps isn't that easy, and testing makes it more difficult, and this project is the solution for you.

With this project, you can test your TRIA maps in Roblox Studio, and see how the map works in TRIA.os.

### Features

- Internal practice tools to help map makers test their maps.
- Directly test the map in studio instead of in TRIA.OS.

### Known Issues / Pending Support

- ‚ùå Inaccurate Physics Simulation, DO NOT use it for maps that need Precision
- ‚ùå Skill Cancel Mechanic
- ‚ùå Zipline Leaning
- ‚ùå Linear Sliding (Actually, I don't know about what this setting do in TRIA)
- ‚ùå Jetstream

### TODO-List

- üõ†Ô∏è Medal Support
- üõ†Ô∏è UI Folder Support (Currently, you can only add UI by using legacy method: `MapLib:GetFeature("PlayerUI"):LoadUI(...)`)
- üõ†Ô∏è Tune Checkpoint Support

### How to use?

1. Download the latest .rbxl file from the <a href="https://github.com/HarukaTea/TRIA-Map-Runner/releases">Releases</a> page.
2. Open the file in Roblox Studio.
3. Delete all the things under workspace.
4. Insert your own model and **UNGROUP** it
(MAKE SURE TO UNGROUP IT, OR THE MAP WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY)

5. Now, you can test the map!
